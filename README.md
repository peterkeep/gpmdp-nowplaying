# Google Play Music Desktop Player: Now Playing

This script reads the current song information from GPMDP's `playback.json` file, and prints the information.

When GPMDP is closed (or isn't playing/paused), it does not display anything.

Mainly this is used with `genmon` to create an xfce panel to display the now playing information.
